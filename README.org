* Implementations of MD program for 2D polydisperse particles
In the field of glass transition studies, valuable insights can be obtained through the execution of molecular dynamics simulations of models of glass formers.
Within this research context, the primary challenge resides in achieving proper equilibration, owing to the slow relaxation of liquids at low temperatures close to the glass transition.

In 2017, a model suitable for a specialized algorithm known as swap Monte Carlo was discovered, marking a significant breakthrough in the field.
Subsequently, this model, two-dimensional polydisperse particles, has gained widespread adoption in the field.
In this repository, I would delve into the efficient implementation of MD programs for this model.
